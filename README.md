## User story
AS A person who wants to reserve movie seats,
I WANT to find an easy-to-use website that will allow me to reserve movie seats without too many buttons or confusing UI elements,
SO THAT I don't have to show up early and save them myself.


GIVEN a website to reserve seats,

WHEN I select the movie I would like to see,
THEN I am shown the seats that are taken and available.

WHEN I select and available seat,
THEN my seat is saved and the ticket price is added to my total.

WHEN I refresh the page,
THEN my seats are saved to local storage so that they will be there when I return.
